# Desafio de programação 1

This project uses:
 -  The 2.1.5 Ruby version.
 -  The last version of Rails(4.2.6) - I used the last version for security reasons, patches and updates
 -  SQLite for database  

### Installing dependencies

You can install ruby with [RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) and then install the correct version of Ruby:

        $ rvm install ruby-2.1.5

You can install all necessaries dependencies using bundler like above:

        $ bundle install

In case you don't have bundler:

        $ gem bundler install

#### Automated tests with RSpec

You can run all tests using:

        $ rspec
